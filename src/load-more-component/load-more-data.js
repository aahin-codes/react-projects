      "The Load More Component allows users to progressively reveal more items—such as posts, products, or images—without overwhelming the initial page load. It supports manual 'Load More' triggers, automatic loading on scroll, customizable batch sizes, and loader animations. This component helps improve performance and keeps the UI clean by displaying content incrementally. Developers can integrate API data, apply filtering, or combine with infinite scroll behavior for a seamless browsing experience.",
