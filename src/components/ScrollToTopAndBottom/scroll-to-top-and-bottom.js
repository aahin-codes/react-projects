      "This project teaches you how to control the browser window using JavaScript. It is really simple geometry. To go to the top, we tell the window to move to pixel '0' (the start). To go to the bottom, we calculate the total height of your page (`scrollHeight`) and tell the window to go there. We also add the `behavior: 'smooth'` property, which turns a jarring jump into a nice, smooth glide.",
