      "This project is a math problem disguised as a UI component. To build it, we need to calculate a percentage: *'How much of the page have I covered?'* We use the formula: `(How far you've scrolled / Total height of page) * 100`. If the result is 50%, we simply set the CSS `width` of a `<div>` to `50%`. It updates in real-time to tell the user exactly how much content is left to read.",
