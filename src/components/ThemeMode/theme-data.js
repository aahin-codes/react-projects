      "This project teaches you that you don't need to write two separate CSS files for Light and Dark mode. Instead, we use 'CSS Variables'. We define a variable like `--bg-color`. When you click the toggle, JavaScript simply changes a class on the `<body>` tag. The CSS sees this change and automatically swaps the variable's value from White to Black. We also use `localStorage` (the browser's memory) so the site remembers your choice even if you refresh the page.",
