      "This is the classic 'Are you sure you want to delete this?' box. Building this from scratch teaches you about 'Layers' in CSS. You create a dark, semi-transparent `<div>` (called a Backdrop) that covers the entire screen to block interactions. Then, you place your actual content box on top of it using `z-index`. It's also a great way to practice keyboard events, like listening for the 'Escape' key to close the window.",
