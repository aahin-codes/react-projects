    description:
      "The Scroll Indicator Component provides real-time feedback on scrolling progress, either for the entire page or specific scrollable elements. It can be styled as a horizontal bar, vertical line, or custom shape, and supports dynamic updates as users scroll. This component improves usability by giving users a clear sense of content length and their position within it. Developers can integrate it with React state, hooks, or event listeners, and customize it with animations, colors, and responsive designs. It works well for articles, dashboards, long forms, or any content-heavy interface, offering an intuitive visual cue for better user experience.",
